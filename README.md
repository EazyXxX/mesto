#### *This is a site created to share experiences*
***

[This site](https://eazyxxx.github.io/mesto/index.html) is an educational format landing page. We promote self-development. For free.

*Mesto* allows everyone to share with each other their pictures of places from which they left the best impressions.

*Mesto* is currently using:

* HTML

* CSS
	* Flexbox and Grid technologies
	* Responsive layout
    * Positioning elements
* Structuring code and files according to BEM and NESTED
* JavaScript
    * Simple scripts responsible for the popup window

The functionality of the project at the moment is not extremely extensive, but in the potential *Mesto* **learn**:

* Sort content according to user preferences to increase views

* Allow users to self-publish new content
